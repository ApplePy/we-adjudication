<!-- the course name, course mark, and school name will be displayed in a line with three buttons: view more, update, and delete -->
<!-- clicking view more will bring up a modal (view-highschool) with the rest of the highschool data -->
<!-- clicking update brings up the same modal (view-highschool) but with an option to save the changes -->
<!-- delete should just delete the record -->
<!-- ******** THESE FUNCTIONALITIES CANT BE TESTED UNTIL ROUTES ARE IN SO IDK IF THEY 100% WORK-->
